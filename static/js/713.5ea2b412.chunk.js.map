It is currently designed and configured to be run\n            on Amazon Linux on an EC2 instance. The aim of this tracker is to\n            provide information on expected resource usage of the CloudWatch\n            Agent so resources can be accurately predicted/allocated to the\n            CloudWatch Agent.\n            <div>\n              <br></br>\n            </div>\n            To obtain this benchmarking data, a t3a.xlarge AL2 EC2 instance is\n            started and CloudWatch Agent is installed on the host. A\n            configuration file is generated for the agent to use with a\n            specified number of logs monitored. When the test begins, the agent\n            is started and lines are written to each log file monitored in the\n            config. The lines are written at a specified rate for the given\n            test. While the agent is running, it is also monitoring it's own\n            resource usage so it can report this data. These metrics are pulled\n            from CloudWatch and saved as the benchmarking data used on this\n            website.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h3>Need Assistance?</h3>\n          <p>\n            Read the Troubleshooting section on our Wiki.\n            <div>\n              <br></br>\n            </div>\n            Need further assistance?

Since\n            several tests are run with different load cases, customers can\n            select a test that best represents a use case similar to theirs, and\n            view the benchmarked resources used by CloudWatch Agent with that\n            simulated configuration and load.
